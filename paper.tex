  About one third of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized
  radio emission on $\sim$Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos. One
  promising model for radio halos is Fermi II acceleration of seed
  relativistic electrons by compressible turbulence in the
  intracluster medium (ICM); Coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from
  the thermal pool. However, the origin of seed electrons has never
  been fully explored. Here, we integrate the Fokker-Planck equation
  of the cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton distributions in
  cosmological simulations of cluster formation. For standard
  assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed electron
  population which produces too centrally concentrated radio
  emission. Instead, we present three plausible scenarios for the seed
  CRs that each can reproduce the spatially flat radio emission
  observed in the Coma cluster. (1) The CR proton-to-electron
  acceleration efficiency $K_\rmn{ep} \sim 0.1$ is assumed to be
  larger than in our Galaxy ($K_\rmn{ep} \sim 10^{-2}$), due to the
  magnetic geometry at the shock. The resulting primary electrons
  dominate the radio emission, which is more extended in comparison to
  radio emission from secondary electrons that result from hadronic CR
  interactions in the ICM. (2) CR protons may stream at the Alfv{\'e}n
  speed to the cluster outskirts when the ICM is relatively
  quiescent. A spatially flat CR proton distribution develops and
  produces the required population of secondary seed electrons. (3)
  The ratio of injected turbulent-to-thermal energy density increases
  significantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. This
  generates a flat radio profile when CRs are reaccelerated even if
  the seed population of CRs is steep with radius. These competing
  non-trivial solutions provide incisive probes of non thermal
  processes in the high-$\beta$ ICM.

\section{Introduction}
About one third of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized
radio emission on $\sim$Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos (RHs)
\citep{2014IJMPD..2330007B}. They appear only in disturbed, merging
clusters and the RH luminosity correlates with the X-ray luminosity
\citep{2001A&A...369..441G,2012A&ARv..20...54F} and the Compton
$y$-parameter \citep{2012MNRAS.421L.112B,2013A&A...554A.140P}. The RHs
show that CR electrons and magnetic fields permeate a large volume
fraction of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The dominant CR source,
given the smoothness and enormous extent of RHs, is thought to be
structure formation shocks \citep{miniati01,pfrommer08}. At the same
time, plasma processes, the origin of magnetic fields and particle
acceleration in a turbulent, high-$\beta$ plasma like the ICM are not
well understood. Radio halos thus provide an incisive probe of
non-thermal processes in the ICM.

There have been two competing models proposed to explain RHs.  The
radio emitting electrons in the ``hadronic model'' are produced in
inelastic (hadronic) CR proton interactions with protons of the
ambient thermal ICM, which generates pions that eventually decay into
electrons and positrons, depending of the charge of the initial pion
(\citealp{1980ApJ...239L..93D,1999APh....12..169B,2001ApJ...562..233M,
  2004A&A...413...17P,2008MNRAS.385.1211P,ensslin11}). CR protons and
heavier nuclei may have been accelerated and injected into the ICM by
structure formation shocks, active galactic nuclei and galactic
winds. However, the strong bimodality that separates X-ray luminous
clusters into radio-active and radio-quite clusters (and requires a
fast switch on/off mechanism of the RH emission) and the very extended
RH emission at low frequencies in Coma (352~MHz) represent a major
challenge to this model class \citep{brunetti12,2014MNRAS.438..124Z}.

The alternative model for RHs is re-energization of seed suprathermal
electrons by Fermi II acceleration when ICM turbulence becomes
transonic during mergers
\citep{1987A&A...182...21S,1993ApJ...406..399G,2001MNRAS.320..365B,
  2004MNRAS.350.1174B,brunetti07,brunetti11,2015ApJ...800...60M}. Due
to the short radiative cooling time of high-energy relativistic
electrons, the cluster synchrotron emission quickly fades away after a
merger, which naturally explains the observed bimodality of RHs
\cite[see e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.429.3564D,2014MNRAS.443.3564D}.

However, there is a salient piece missing in the turbulent
reacceleration model. It relies heavily on the assumption of an
abundant, volume-filling population of seed suprathermal electrons;
direct Fermi II acceleration from the thermal pool is precluded by
strong Coulomb losses
\citep{2008ApJ...682..175P,2012ApJ...759..113C}. These seeds are
presumed to be either fossil CR electrons (CRes) accelerated by
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) during structure formation
\citep{1999ApJ...520..529S}, or secondaries injected by hadronic
interaction of CR protons (CRps) with thermal protons
\citep{brunetti11}. While analytic estimates have been made, there has
been no ab initio demonstration that structure formation can lead to
the required abundance of seed electrons with the correct spatial and
spectral characteristics. This is a non-trivial requirement: Coulomb
cooling in dense cluster cores is severe, and DSA fossil electrons may
not survive. On the other hand, for secondaries to constitute the seed
population, the CRp population required in the best-studied case of
the Coma cluster must have a very broad and flat (or even slightly
inverted) spatial profile \citep{brunetti12}, in contrast with the
thermal plasma whose energy density declines steeply with radius. In
\AP{the left panel of} Fig.~\ref{fig:Edens} we show that such a
distribution is not predicted by cosmological simulations \cite[see
  also][]{pinzke10,2014MNRAS.439.2662V}. \CP{If CRps are predominantly
  advected with the cluster plasma, their distribution will be peaked
  towards the cluster center and shows a similar characteristics as
  the thermal plasma. As a consequence, the distribution of secondary
  electrons and the resulting radio synchrotron emission is also
  peaked since the hadronic reaction is a two-body scattering process
  (see Fig.~Fig.~\ref{fig:Edens}). Hence, the simulated emission falls
  short of the observed extended and flat radio profile of the Coma
  cluster.}

    distribution of seed CRps that generate secondary electrons via
    p-p collisions required to reproduce Coma radio brightness
    observations after Fermi-II reacceleration \citep{brunetti12}. The
    blue solid line shows the distribution of fossil CRps found in
    cosmological simulations, which disagrees with the required
    profile. \AP{To better compare the two models in this figure, we
      normalize the required distribution of CRps by fixing the total
      CRp energy $E_\rmn{CR}$ to 0.3 percent of the total thermal
      energy, consistent with observations
      \citep{2014ApJ...787...18A,2012ApJ...757..123A}. Right: the
      ratio of turbulent-to-thermal energy densities (solid lines) and

      energy densities are parametrized as $\epsilon_\rmn{turb}
      \propto \epsilon_\rmn{th}^{(\alpha_{\rmn{tu}}+1)/2}/T^{1/4}$ and
      normalized such that the total turbulent energy in compressible
      modes $E_\rmn{turb}$ for each scenario makes up about 6\% of the
      total thermal energy $E_\rmn{th}$ inside the radio halo
      ($R_\rmn{RH}\approx0.6R_{200}$). The turbulent profiles explore
      the uncertainty in the cluster turbulence and are motivated by
      the cosmological simulation in
      \citep{2009ApJ...705.1129L,2010ApJ...725.1452S,2011A&A...529A..17V}.}}
  \label{fig:Edens}
\end{figure*}

Indeed, arriving at a seed population with the required
characteristics is highly constraining, and has the potential to teach
us much about the origin of CRps/CRes in clusters.  \CP{In this work,
  we use our hydrodynamical zoom simulations of galaxy clusters in a
  cosmological setting to follow the distribution functions of seed
  CRp and CRe population and integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of
  CR transport along Lagrangian particle trajectories. We resolve
  injection at structure formation shocks, account for various loss
  processes of CRs, and -- most importantly -- model second-order
  Fermi acceleration by CR interactions with magnetised
  turbulence. However, we assume a simplified and stationary model for
  magnetic fields and turbulence. We do not account for the
  time-varying energy density in compressible waves, which are thought
  to be necessary for the acceleration process
  \citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}, as the cluster merger proceeds.  So
  our approach is orthogonal (and complementary) to e.g.,
  \citealp{2015ApJ...800...60M}. This enables us to vary parameters
  associated with the unknown continuation of magneto-hydrodynamical
  turbulence below the MHD scale and the overall amplitude of
  compressible waves.}

In this paper we consider three new scenarios that
individually or combined can reproduce the observed radio profiles and
spectrum in the Coma cluster without violating gamma-ray constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Model {\em M-primaries}.} If the acceleration efficiency of CRps is below
  about $0.1$~{\%} in weak (perpendicular) shocks and the ratio of injected
  electrons-to-protons $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim 0.1$, this yields a dominant primary
  population with a flat spatial distribution, since primaries have a weaker
  density dependence than secondaries.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-streaming}.} Here, we account for streaming CRps that
  produce flat distributions of CRps in the ICM
  \citep{ensslin11,wiener13,2014MNRAS.438..124Z}, which also flattens the
  secondary electron distribution.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-turbulence}.} Here, we adopt a spatially
  flatter turbulent profile than what was adopted in \citet{brunetti12},
  but where seed CRps follow the steep profile that is suggested by
  structure formation simulations.
\end{enumerate}

To pursue these three possibilities further, we employ cosmological
simulations of CRs in clusters. In tandem with new insights from our
recent work on DSA generated fossil electrons \citep{pinzke13}, we
generate the first quantitative calculation of primary and secondary
seed electrons and compare to observations in the Coma cluster. For
the most part, we adopt parameters that are used in previous work:
\AP{for details, see \citep[][ turbulent
    spectrum]{brunetti07,brunetti11}, \citep[][ injection scale of
    turbulens]{2015ApJ...800...60M}, \citep[][ energy density of
    turbulence]{2009ApJ...705.1129L,2010ApJ...725.1452S,2011A&A...529A..17V},
  for CR acceleration in shocks, \citep[][ in particular
    $K_{\rmn{ep}}$, acceleration efficiency]{pinzke13}, and for
  cosmological simulations, \citep[][ i.e., shock history, temperature
    profile, density profile, magnetic field profile]{pinzke10}.} All
these parameters are uncertain, and could potentially change our
predictions. We leave exploration of parameter space and the
interaction between free parameters to future work.

\section{Method} 

The transport of relativistic electrons and protons in
the ICM is a complex process that depends both on the details of the
thermal component (gas density, temperature, and pressure) as well as
non-thermal component (turbulence, magnetic fields, fossil CRs). We
use high resolution galaxy cluster simulations to derive the thermal
and fossil CR properties (shock accelerated primary CRes and CRps, as
well as secondary CRes produced in p-p collisions)
\citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,pfrommer08,pinzke10,pinzke13}. In this
paper we focus on our simulated cluster, g72a, which is a massive
$1.6\times10^{15}\,M_\odot$ cluster that experienced a merger about
1-2 Gyrs ago \citep{2009MNRAS.399..497D}. Since the cluster mass,
density and temperature profiles are all similar to the well studied
Coma cluster \citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,pinzke10}, we will compare our
calculations to radio and gamma-ray observations of Coma.

\subsection{Acceleration}

In our Galaxy, the CRe-to-CRp ratio at a few GeV is $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim
10^{-2}$. Hence, we adopt this as a fiducial value for the CRe-to-CRp
acceleration efficiency (see \cite{pinzke13} for more
discussion). However, as recent PIC simulations have shown, this is
likely very different at weak shocks, with electrons efficiently
accelerated at perpendicular shocks
\citep{2014ApJ...794..153G,2014ApJ...797...47G}, and ions efficiently
accelerated at parallel shocks \citep{2014ApJ...783...91C}. Thus,
depending on magnetic geometry, $K_{\rmn{ep}}$ could be either larger
or smaller. In this work we use a simple test-particle model for the
CRp acceleration, where we adopt a fit to Monte Carlo simulations of
the thermal leakage process that relates the momentum of injected
protons to the thermal energy of the shocked plasma \citep{kang11}. We
set an upper limit on the ratio of accelerated proton-to-dissipated
energy in the downstream of strong shocks that varies from 1-10\%,
depending on the adopted model (for more details, see Section
\ref{sec:results}). In order not to violate energy conservation with a
fixed limit for the acceleration efficiency, we steepen the spectral
index of the accelerated CRps at the limit \citep{pinzke13}, which
mimics the non-linear CR modification of the shock
\citep{ellison00}. For weak shocks the efficiency is a factor 10-100
lower and well below the limit. Some observations of radio relics
suggest high values of $K_{\rmn{ep}}$, due to the absence of gamma-ray
emission, which probes the CRp population
\citep{2014MNRAS.437.2291V}. This suggests primary CRes as a viable
alternative scenario to secondary CRes as seeds for the giant RHs. In
our {\em M-primaries} scenario, the injected distribution of CRes is
derived in the same way as for the CRps. Once they have been
accelerated to relativistic energies, injected electrons and protons
are indistinguishable. We therefore assume that CRp and CRe have the
same distribution function $f_\rmn{CRe}(p) = K_\rmn{ep}
f_\rmn{CRp}(p)$, with a different normalization (due to differing
acceleration efficiencies) $K_\rmn{ep}=0.1$ \citep[which is viable for
  primarily perpendicular shocks][]{2014ApJ...794..153G}. While this
appears to contradict the radial bias of magnetic fields in the bulk
of the ICM as suggested by observations \citep{2010NatPh...6..520P}
and cluster simulations \citep{2011ApJ...740...81R}, it does not
necessarily apply to the accretion shock regions, which show a field
geometry with a net perpendicular bias with respect to the shock
normal---at least for giant radio relics \citep{2010Sci...330..347V}.

\subsection{Cosmic ray transport}
As previously noted, secondaries produced by shock accelerated CRp
have the wrong spatial profile to explain RH observations; because
they arise from a two body process, they are too centrally
concentrated. They also produce $\gamma$-ray emission in excess of
Fermi-LAT upper limits
\citep{2012ApJ...757..123A,brunetti12,2014ApJ...787...18A}. However,
if CRps stream in the ICM, then their spatial profile could
potentially flatten sufficiently \citep{ensslin11,wiener13}. This
scenario is very attractive: it generates seed electrons with the
right spatial footprint, and by removing CRps from the core, obeys
gamma-ray constraints. Turbulence plays two opposing roles:
Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence damps waves generated by the CR streaming
instability \citep{yan02,farmer04}, thus reducing self-confinement;
but compressible fast modes scatter CRs directly. Turbulent damping is
still efficient for highly subsonic conditions \citep{wiener13}, while
we assume compressible fast modes to only provide effective spatial
confinement during the periods of transonic, highly super-Alfv{\'e}nic
($M_{\rm A} \sim 5$) turbulence associated with mergers. Thus, CRs can
stream out when the cluster is kinematically quiescent. Furthermore,
even Alfv{\'e}nic streaming timescales are relatively short
\cite[$\sim 0.1-0.5$ Gyr;][]{wiener13} compared to the timescale on
which the CRp population is built up. Based on these findings, we
adopt a toy model for our \Mstream scenario in which CR streaming
instantaneously produces flat CRp profiles. \sout{We assume that CRs cannot
stream significantly past perpendicular $B$-fields at the accretion
shock, so that the total number of CRs is conserved within the galaxy
cluster during the streaming process.}

Given a seed population of CRs, we adopt essentially the same set of
plasma physics assumptions as the reacceleration model for RHs
\citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}. We solve the isotropic, gyro-phase
averaged Fokker-Planck equation (via a Crank-Nicholson scheme) for the
time evolution of the CRe distribution in the Lagrangian frame
\citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}:
\begin{eqnarray}
{{d f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)}\over{d t}} &\!=&
\frac{\partial}{\partial p}
\left\{
f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)\left[
\left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm C} 
+ \frac{p}{3}\left(\bnabla\bcdot \bvel\right)
+ \left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm r}\right.\right.
\nonumber\\
&-& \left.\left.{1\over{p^2}}{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}\left(p^2 D_{pp}\right) 
\right]\right\} - \left(\bnabla\bcdot \bvel\right) f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)
- \bnabla\bcdot \vec{F}_\rmn{stream}
\nonumber\\
&+& {{\partial^2 }\over{\partial p^2}}
\left[
D_{pp} f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t) \right]+ Q_{\rmn{e}}\left[p,t;f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\right]   \, .
\label{elettroni}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $f_{\rmn{e}}$ is the one-dimensional distribution in position $x$
(suppressed for clarity), momentum $p$ and time $t$ (which is
normalized such that the number density is given by
$n_{\rmn{e}}(t)=\int d p f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)$), $d/dt=\partial/\partial
t+\bvel\bcdot\bnabla$ is the Lagrangian derivative, $\bvel$ is the gas
velocity, $|dp/dt|$ represents radiative (r) and Coulomb (C) losses,
$D_{pp}$ is the momentum space diffusion coefficient, and
$Q_{\rmn{e}}$ denotes the injection rate of primary and secondary
electrons in the ICM. The $\bnabla\bcdot \bvel$ terms represent
adiabatic gains and losses \AP{and the $\bnabla\bcdot
  \vec{F}_\rmn{stream}$ terms represent super-Alfv{\'e}nic CR
  streaming. For details about $F_\rmn{stream}$ please see
  \citet{wiener13}.} During post-processing of our Coma-like cluster
simulation, we solve the Fokker-Planck equation over a redshift
interval from $z=5$ to 0. The simulated cluster undergoes a major
merger over the last 1-2~Gyrs that \AP{is thought to inject large
  turbulent eddies. Following \citet{brunetti07,brunetti11} \citep[see
    also][]{2004ApJ...614..757Y,2015ApJ...800...60M} we assume that
  about one Gyr after core passage the fields have decayed down to the
  smallest scales where reacceleration is most efficient ($D_{pp}\sim
  k_\rmn{cut}$) and the radio halo turns on shortly after. Note that
  the exact decay time of the turbulens is of minor importance, since
  the thermal and CR quantities are very similar a few 100 Myrs before
  and after $z=0$ where we have chosen to evaluate the simulations.}
\sout{injects large turbulent eddies. After about 1~Gyr those have
  decayed down to the scale needed to reaccelerate particles.} This
delay naturally explains why giant radio halos are only seen in a
fraction of all merging clusters. In all our calculations we assume
that turbulent reacceleration efficiently accelerates particles for
$\tau_D\sim650$~Myrs (which is roughly the cascade time on which
turbulence is damped) and that during this turbulent phase CR
streaming and spatial diffusion can be neglected. In our \Mstream
model, CR streaming and diffusion are incorporated separately during
kinematically quiescent times that precede the merger. As a result,
flat CRp profiles are produced on relatively short timescales ($\sim
0.1-0.5$ Gyr). \AP{This allows us to implicitly solve for CR streaming
  in our calculations, where we adopt a toy model that enforce a flat
  CRp profile at all quiescent times \citep{wiener13}. We assume that
  CRs cannot stream significantly past perpendicular $B$-fields at the
  accretion shock, so that the total number of CRs is conserved within
  the virial radius during the streaming process. Finally, since
  streaming is much more efficient for the CRps, we can ignore this
  effect for the CRes.}

The time evolution of the spectral energy distribution of CRps,
$f_{\rmn{p}}$, is similarly given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
{{d f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)}\over{d t}} &=&
{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}
\left\{
f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\left[ \left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm C}
+ \frac{p}{3}\left(\bnabla\bcdot \bvel\right)\right.\right.
\nonumber\\
&-&\left.\left. {1\over{p^2}}{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}\left(p^2 D_{pp}\right)
\right]\right\} - \left(\bnabla\bcdot \bvel\right) f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)
- \bnabla\bcdot \vec{F}_\rmn{stream}
\nonumber\\
&+& {{\partial^2 }\over{\partial p^2}}
\left[ D_{pp} f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t) \right] - {{f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)}\over{\tau_{\rm had}(p)}}
+ Q_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\, ,
\label{eq:FP_p}
\end{eqnarray}
where $Q_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)$ denotes the injection rate of shock
accelerated CRps as a function of momentum $p$ and time $t$, and
$\tau_{\rm had}$ is the timescale of hadronic losses that produce
pions via CRp collisions with thermal protons of the ICM
\cite[e.g.][]{brunetti11}.  


\subsection{Turbulent reacceleration}

We incorporate momentum diffusion for electrons and protons from
transit-time-damping (TTD) resonance with compressible MHD turbulence,
to model Fermi-II reacceleration \citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}. The
TTD resonance requires the wave frequency
$\omega=k_\parallel\upsilon_\parallel$, where $k_\parallel$ and
$\upsilon_\parallel$ are the parallel (projected along the magnetic
field) wavenumber and particle velocity, respectively. This implies
that the particle transit time across the confining wave region
matches the wave period, $\lambda_{\parallel}/v_{\parallel}=T$. Note,
the CRs' gyroradius does not enter the resonance condition. Hence the
CRs that are in resonance with compressible waves experience Fermi-II
acceleration irrespectively of the length scale of the perturbation.

However, the resonance changes the component of particle momentum
parallel to seed magnetic fields, which over time leads to increasing
anisotropy in the particle distribution that decreases the efficiency
of reacceleration with time. As in \citet{brunetti11}, we assume that
there exists a mechanism---such as the firehose instability---that
isotropizes the CR distribution function at the gyroscale and on the
reacceleration time scale, which ensures sustained efficient
reacceleration with time. The particle pitch-angle averaged
momentum-diffusion coefficient of isotropic particles that couple to
fast magnetosonic modes via TTD resonance is \citep[][ Eqn. 47]{brunetti07}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  D_{pp}(p,t) = \frac{\pi}{16} \frac{p^2}{c\,\rho}
  \left\langle\frac{\beta |B_k|^2}{16 \pi \,W}\right\rangle
  I_\theta
  \int_{k_\rmn{cut}}\mathcal{W}(k)k\,d k\,,
\label{eq:dpp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta$ is the thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio, and $c$
is the speed of light. The energy density $W$ of a mode in a
magnetized plasma stems from both electromagnetic fields and resonant
particles. For a high-$\beta$ plasma, the pitch angle averaged ratio of
beta-weighted magnetic-to-total energy density saturates to $\langle\beta
|B_k|^2/2W\rangle\approx 10^{1.4}$ (see Figure 2 in
\citealt{brunetti07}). The pitch angle of the CR momentum with the
magnetic field orientation is given by $\theta$, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:I_theta}
  I_\theta=\int_0^{\arccos(\Vph/c)} d\theta {\frac{ \sin^3 \theta }{
    |\cos \theta | }}
\left[1+\left(\frac{\Vph}{c\,\cos{\theta}}\right)^2\right]^2.
\end{equation}
Here $V_\rmn{ph}$ is the phase velocity of the fast magnetosonic waves
given approximately by the sound speed, $\Vph \sim c_\rmn{s}$. For a
sound speed typical for the ICM of 1000~km/s, $I_\theta\approx5$. As
in \cite{brunetti07}, we initially assume that the velocity of
turbulent eddies is $V_0\approx 0.47 c_\rmn{s}$ throughout the
cluster. This gives a turbulent acceleration time scale, $\tau_{D} =
p^2/4D_{pp}$, that is typically few 100 Myrs in the ICM (see
Tab.~\ref{tab:timescales} for more details).


\AP{We focus on a scenario where the turbulence is injected at the
  largest scale that is driven by the merging cluster and accreting
  matter. The diffusion equation for isotropic MHD turbulence in
  $k$--space is given by}
\begin{eqnarray}
&{{\partial {\mathcal W}(k,t) }\over{\partial t}}
=
{{\partial}\over{\partial k}}
\left[
k^2 D_{kk}
{{\partial}\over{\partial k}}
\left( {{ {\mathcal W}(k,t) }\over{k^2}} \right)
\right]
- \sum_i \Gamma_i (k,t) {\mathcal W}(k,t)
+ I(k,t)\nonumber\\
&
\label{modes_kinetic}
\end{eqnarray}
\AP{where we assume that the volumetric injection rate of turbulence
  $I(k,t)$ is constant over time with a fixed rate $I_0$ so that
  $I(k,t) \equiv I(k) = I_0\,\delta (k - k_o)$. The different damping
  terms are given by $\Gamma_i(k,t)$ and $D_{kk}$ is the wave--wave diffusion
  coefficient of magnetosonic waves in the $k$--space represented by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Dkk}
    D_{kk} \approx \Vph k^4
    \left(\frac{\mathcal{W}(k)}{\rho\,\Vph^2}\right)\,.

We adopt a simplified isotropic MHD turbulent spectrum \AP{based on
Kraichnan's picture} for the fast modes per elemental range $dk$ of
  the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Wk}
  \mathcal{W}(k) =
\sqrt{2/7\,I_0\,\rho\,\langle \Vph \rangle}\,k^{-3/2},
\end{equation}
for $k_0<k<k_\rmn{cut}$. \AP{Here we adopt an injection scale of the
  turbulence, $k_0= 2\pi/(1~\mbox{Mpc})$, motivated by recent
  state-of-art simulations

    modes ($X_\rmn{tu}$) which is also highly uncertain. Increasing

    keep $D_{pp}$ at the value needed to explain
    observations.}}\sout{, where we assume an injection scale for the
  turbulence, $k_0= 2\pi/(100~\mbox{kpc})$.} \AP{The profile of
  injected turbulence is also highly uncertain, however we assume it
  correlates to the thermal energy density to some power of the
  merging clusters. Hence we assume volumetric injection rate of
  turbulent energy, $I_0\propto \epsilon_\rmn{th}^{\alpha_\rmn{tu}}$,
  and determine the normalization by requiring that the turbulent
  energy in compressible modes $E_\rmn{turb}=\int \int \mathcal{W}(k)
  \rmn{d}k \rmn{d}V = X_\rmn{tu} E_\rmn{th}$, where $E_\rmn{th}$ is
  the total thermal energy. We adopt a turbulent energy
  ratio\footnote{Simulations show that the compressible modes
    contribute a factor $0.2-0.4$ to the total turbulent energy
    \citep{2013ApJ...771..131B,2015ApJ...800...60M}. Furthermore, the
    total turbulent energy is typically $10-30$\% of the thermal
    energy in a cluster which is in agreement with our adopted value
    of $X_\rmn{tu}$.}  $X_\rmn{tu}=0.06$ within the radio halo.} In
this work we investigate different spatial models for injected
turbulence. With the above choice of normalization, the turbulent
energy density becomes $\epsilon_\rmn{turb} \propto
\epsilon_\rmn{th}^{\alpha_\rmn{tu}}/T^{1/4}$, where $T$ is the
temperature of the gas, $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.67$ for \Mflatturb,
$\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.82$ for \Mstream, and $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.88$ for
\Mprimary. Note that in previous work on the Coma cluster,
$\epsilon_\rmn{turb} \propto \epsilon_\rmn{th}$ was adopted which
roughly corresponds to $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 1$ \citep{brunetti12} and
together with the different distributions for seed CRes constitute the
main differences compared to our work. Our flatter turbulent profiles
are motivated by fits to cosmological simulations
\citep{2009ApJ...705.1129L,2010ApJ...725.1452S,2011A&A...529A..17V,2012ApJ...758...74B}
and the range indicates uncertainties of the turbulent profile in
Coma. Future observations (by Astro-H) and simulations will help to
clarify this issue. Provided dissipation of turbulence in the ICM is
collisionless, turbulent cascades of compressible modes become
suppressed when thermal and relativistic particles resonantly interact
with magnetosonic waves via TTD on a timescale $\Gamma^{-1}$ that
approaches the cascading timescale given by $\tau_{kk} \approx
k^2/D_{kk}$. Thus, the cascade is suppressed for wave numbers above
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kc}
  k_\rmn{cut} \approx \frac{81}{14} \frac{I_0}{\rho \langle \Vph \rangle}
  \left(\frac{\langle\sum_i \Gamma_i(k,\theta)\rangle}{k}\right)^{-2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $2\pi/k_\rmn{cut}\sim 0.1-1$~kpc in the ICM. This constitutes an
effective mean free path for CRs, unless plasma instabilities can
mediate interactions between turbulence and particles on smaller
scales \citep{brunetti11}. In this work we only consider damping of
the turbulence via TTD due to thermal electrons, and neglect
subdominant damping with thermal protons and relativistic particles
(conversely, the turbulence has important effects on the
reacceleration of CRs). The latter will be subdominant in the ICM for
a CR-to-thermal energy density ratio $\lesssim 10 \%$
\citep{brunetti07}, which is always satisfied in our models. The
azimuthally averaged turbulent damping rate from thermal electrons
\citep{brunetti07} in a high-$\beta$ plasma is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Gamma_e}
\langle\Gamma_{\rmn{e}}\rangle \approx \langle k\,\Vph\,\sqrt{3\pi
  x/20}\exp(-5x/3)\sin^2{\theta}\rangle\approx 0.0435k\,\Vph, 
\end{equation}
where $x=(m_{\rmn{e}}/m_{\rmn{p}})/\cos^2{\theta}$. To compute the
synchrotron surface brightness profiles, we use the profile of the
magnetic field strengths derived from Faraday rotation observations of
Coma \citep{bonafede10} in combination with the density profile
derived from X-ray measurements \citep{1992A&A...259L..31B}.

\AP{For reference we show in Table~\ref{tab:timescales} both the thermal
  quantities and the timescales for CR cooling and (re)acceleration
  for three different spatial regions of the RH. Interestingly the
  reacceleration timescale $\tau_D$ is very similar between our three
  models, where the difference comes from turbulent profile
  parameterized with $\alpha_\rmn{tu}$. This implies that even small
  differences in the turbulent profile could impact the seed CRs
  significantly.}

\section{Results and Discussion} 
\label{sec:results}
\AP{In this section we show that our three models individually
  reproduce the observed Coma radio halo without violating gamma-ray
  bounds. The level of emission is mainly driven by how efficient the
  CRs are reaccelerated and for how long. The diffusion constant,
  $D_\rmn{pp}\propto I_0/\rho c_s \propto
  X_\rmn{tu}^2k_0\epsilon_\rmn{tu}^{\alpha_\rmn{tu}-1}\sqrt{T}$, where
  we adopt the same level of compressible turbulence,
  $X_\rmn{tu}=0.06$, for all models. The reaccelerated CRs are
  super-exponentially dependent on this parameter as long as $\tau_D >
  \tau_\rmn{cl}$, where $\tau_\rmn{cl}$ represent the duration of
  reacceleration of the merger which we assume to be 650~Myrs
  long. Note that  fixing $D_\rmn{pp}$ allows us to relate
  $\tau_\rmn{cl} \propto X_\rmn{tu}^2 \propto k_0$ that ultimately sets
  the normalization for $D_\rmn{pp}$. We also exploit the large
  uncertainty in the turbulent profile and adjust $\alpha_\rmn{tu}$
  for each model so that the CRs have the correct spatial profile to
  match the radio emission. The shape of the spectrum for each of
  model is more complicated and is determined both from reacceleration
  and as well as the gains and losses during the formation of the
  cluster. It depends only weakly on the specifics of the CR injection
  at the shocks (where the Mach number distribution of the shocks is
  the most important quantity). The normalization of the spectrum is
  mainly determined from the maximum acceleration efficiency (together
  with the uncertain parameters $X_\rmn{tu}$, $\tau_\rmn{cl}$, and
  $k_0$). Given the freedom in the turbulens, it might not be
  surprising that we match the radio profile in Coma. Although,
  matching the spectrum without violating gamma-ray bounds for each of
  our three models is more surprising and is not a consequence of
  parameter fitting. We believe that it is ultimately a consequence of
  the adopted physics and hint that reacceleration is a viable
  explanation for giant radio halos. Below we discuss in more detail
  the different emission components of Coma.}

\subsection{Gamma-rays}
After turbulent reacceleration, the volume-weighted, relative CRp
energy density and relative CRp number density inside the RH for
\Mflatturb (\Mstream), are found to be 2 (3) \% and $2\times10^{-8}$
($5\times10^{-8}$), respectively. As we will see later, these
densities are just of the right order of magnitude to reproduce radio
observations in the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray emission from CRps
that produce decaying neutral pions could be substantial if the CRps
are reaccelerated efficiently enough, hence it is interesting to
estimate this emission for our models and compare to upper limits. We
predict the gamma-ray emission from \Mflatturb (\Mstream) with
$F_\gamma(>500\,\rmn{MeV})=4\times10^{-10} (5\times10^{-10}) \mathrm{
  \,ph\, s}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The fluxes from these models are
slightly larger than in \cite{brunetti12}, where the differences comes
from our steeper CRp profiles in addition to simulation based
formalism we rely on that accounts for both Coulomb and hadronic
losses during the build up of the CR distribution in contrast to the
scaling relations adopted in their paper. Interestingly the gamma-ray
flux from both our scenarios are just below recent Fermi-LAT limits
derived from a gamma-ray profile similar to \Mflatturb where
$F_\gamma(>500\,\rmn{MeV})<5.3\times10^{-10} \mathrm{ \,ph\,
  s}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ \footnote{Fabio Zandanel, private
  communication. See also
  \citet{2014MNRAS.440..663Z,2014ApJ...787...18A}. and will be probed
  in the next few years by Fermi-LAT. } The spectral index of the CRp
distribution is relatively steep ($\alpha_{\rmn{p}}\sim2.6$) for the
CRp energies $E \gtrsim 10$~GeV that are relevant for the injection of
radio-emitting secondary CRes. The steep spectrum is ultimately a
consequence \AP{of the shock history of the simulated cluster, with a
  weak dependence on} our test particle model for Fermi-I acceleration
\citep{pinzke13}, where we steepen the spectral index to avoid
acceleration efficiencies above $\zeta_{\rmn{p}} \sim 10\%$.

\subsection{Radio profile}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_profile}, we find that all three scenarios in
which the seeds undergo Fermi-II reacceleration can reproduce the Coma
RH profile at 352~MHz. In the panel {\it Brunetti et al. (2012)} we
show that without CR streaming or a flat turbulent profile, our
simulations of reaccelerated CRs produce radio profiles that are too
steep. Indeed, even using the assumptions of previous work -- where
complete freedom in the seed population was allowed -- it is not
possible to reproduce observations in both frequencies in any
model. Note that decreasing acceleration efficiency with radius does
not change this conclusion much because of the weak radial dependence
of $D_\rmn{pp}(R)\propto
\epsilon_\rmn{th}(R)^{\alpha_\rmn{tu}-1}\sqrt{T(R)}$. This
signals that the problem is generic and requires either additional
modifications to the plasma physics of acceleration or a better
understanding of potential observational systematics. In addition
there are differences in the simulated density and temperature
profiles in comparison to the observed profile in Coma that impact the
CR abundance as well as cooling and reacceleration.

In principle, reacceleration via TTD leads to spectral steepening with
particle energy due to the inefficiency of the acceleration process to
counter the stronger cooling losses with increasing energy. Since
synchrotron emission peaks at frequency $\nu_\rmn{syn}\simeq 1\,
B/\mu\rmn{G} (\gamma/10^4)^2\,\rmn{GHz}$, this translates into a
spectral steepening of the radio spectrum (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). A given radio window samples higher
energy electrons for a decreasing field strength in the cluster
outskirts. Hence, the spectral steepening with energy should translate
into a radial spectral steepening \citep{brunetti12}. However, because
of the weak dependence of the electron Lorentz factor on emission
frequency ($\gamma\propto\sqrt{\nu_\rmn{syn}}$), this effect is only
visible in our simulations for $\nu_\rmn{syn}\gtrsim5$~GHz. Most
importantly, our simulated fluid elements at a given radius sample a
broad distribution of shock history, density and temperature, which
implies very similar synchrotron brightness profiles at
$\nu_\rmn{syn}=352$~MHz and 1.4 GHz. The discrepancy of the observed
and simulated 1.4 GHz profiles could instead be due to systematic flux
calibration error in single dish observations. These could arise, for
instance, due to errors in point source subtraction. Interestingly, we
can match the 1.4 GHz data if we reduce the zero point by adding 10\%
of the central flux to every data point; this flattens the outer
profile\footnote{Lawrence Rudnick, private communication.}.
Alternatively, this may point to weaknesses in the theoretical
modeling of the particle acceleration process and may require a
stronger cutoff in the particle energy spectrum.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Radio spectrum}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum} we show that our three models that
include Fermi-II reacceleration can individually reproduce the
convexly curved total radio spectrum found in the Coma cluster. Seed
CRs in \Mstream and \Mflatturb that do not experience turbulent
reacceleration have a power-law spectrum in disagreement with
observations. In order to match both the spatial and spectral profiles
in Coma, we adopt an acceleration efficiency for the strongest shocks
in our three models \Mprimary, \Mstream, and \Mflatturb to
$\zeta_{\rmn{e}} <0.003$, $\zeta_{\rmn{p}} < 0.1$, and
$\zeta_{\rmn{p}}<0.03$, respectively. Following the Mach number
($\mathcal{M}$)-dependence of the acceleration efficiency suggested in
\cite{pinzke13}, the efficiency in weak shocks ($\mathcal{M}\sim
2.5-3.5$) that dominates the CR distribution function, has an
acceleration efficiency for protons $\zeta_{\rmn{p}}\sim0.0001-0.01$,
and for electrons $\zeta_{\rmn{e}}\sim 0.001$. Interestingly, we find
that the radio luminosity from clusters in the OFF-state (DSA only)
and ON-state (DSA and reacceleration) differ by about a factor 10 in
all our three models. However, note that for \Mprimary, the primary
CRes that generate most of the radio emission from the cluster in the
OFF-state are dominated by only a small fraction of the CRes. These
electrons are injected very recently and have not had time to cool
yet. Hence we expect there to be a large variance in the OFF-state of
different simulated clusters.

While the radio surface brightness has an approximate linear
dependence on the acceleration efficiency, it has a strong non-linear
dependence on the level of compressible turbulence. Below a critical
level ($X_\rmn{thres,tu} = 
\frac{400\,\rmn{Myrs}}{\tau_\rmn{cl}} X_\rmn{tu}\approx 0.04$ in our fiducial model),
turbulent reacceleration is negligible, while it rises sharply above
this threshold. For instance, for $X_\rmn{tu}\gtrsim0.04$, a factor 2 change
in $X_\rmn{tu}$ changes the radio surface brightness by $\sim
10-100$. In principle this threshold behavior allows us to provide a
strict lower bound on turbulence in radio halos. An even more
stringent bound on $X_\rmn{tu}$ can be inferred from combining radio
observations with the gamma-ray observations where the predicted
fluxes from both \Mstream and \Mflatturb are close to the upper limits
set by Fermi-LAT. If $X_\rmn{tu}$ is smaller than in our adopted
models (where we assume $X_\rmn{tu}=0.06$), then the efficiency of DSA
has to be larger than $\zeta_\rmn{p}\sim 0.1$ for the secondary CRes
to reproduce the radio observations. However, since the turbulent
reacceleration acts on both the secondary CRes and the CRps, while
$\zeta_\rmn{p}$ only affects the CRps, these models would produce too
much gamma-rays. Hence we conclude that $X_\rmn{tu}\gtrsim0.06$ if all
other parameters are kept fixed. \AP{Although, we caution the reader
  to take this limit too stringent since there are degeneracies between
  the uncertain parameters
  $X_\rmn{tu}\propto\sqrt{\tau_\rmn{D}}\propto \sqrt{k_0}$.} We will
explore this parameter space further in future work.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The standard reacceleration model for radio halos (RHs) requires a
population of seed electrons to undergo turbulent
reacceleration. These seeds are generally thought to be secondary
electrons from hadronic cosmic ray proton (CRp) interactions. In this
work we use cosmological simulations to derive a population of seed CR
protons originating from structure formation shocks and merger shocks
during the cluster build up. The resulting secondary population is
inconsistent with RH observations. We propose three possible solutions
where all reaccelerated CRs produce gamma-ray emission below current
upper limits. Additionally, they reproduce both the spectrum and the
surface brightness profiles of the Coma radio halo:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Model {\em M-primaries}.} If indeed the acceleration
  efficiency of CRps is below about $0.1$ {\%} in weak shocks and the
  ratio of injected electrons and protons is $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim
  10^{-1}$, CR electrons accelerated directly in shocks dominate over
  secondaries.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-streaming}.} Alternatively, CRps could stream
  out of the central core and produce flat CR profiles. This seed
  population of secondary CRes also has the correct spatial and
  spectral features alone, or potentially complements primaries to
  explain radio observations.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-turbulence}.}  Finally, injected turbulence
  that is flatter than in previously adopted models, which allows seed
  CRps to follow the steep radial profile that is suggested by
  structure formation simulations.
\end{enumerate}

Combining radio observations with gamma-ray constraints can be very
useful to learn about the plasma of the intracluster medium. Our
models (ii) and (iii) relies on CRps to induce secondary CRes that
produce the observed radio emission. In addition proton-proton
collisions produce neutral pions that decay into gamma rays. Since
turbulent reacceleration acts on both CRes and CRps, while the DSA
acceleration efficiency ($\zeta_p$) only acts on the CRps, radio
observations fix the relation between $X_\rmn{tu}$ (the ratio of the
total turbulent energy in compressional modes to the total thermal
energy) and the acceleration efficiency. With the addition of
gamma-ray constraints from Fermi-LAT, we can derive a lower limit to
$X_\rmn{tu}\gtrsim0.06$ and a upper limit to the acceleration
efficiencies of $\zeta_p\lesssim 10\%$ ($\zeta_p\lesssim 3\%$) for
the two models, respectively, for our current choices of other
parameters.

How could we distinguish the different possibilities of a dominating
primary or secondary seed population of electrons observationally?
One possibility that is relative insensitive to adopted parameters in
our models is to use high-frequency radio observations (with e.g., the
Jansky Very Large Array) where turbulent reacceleration (which has a
high energy cutoff) is no longer efficient (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). The negative flux bowl of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect introduces a cutoff of the RH spectrum at
frequencies above $\gtrsim 10$~GHz \citep[][ depending on cluster mass
  and redshift]{2002A&A...396L..17E,Pfrommer:2003mk}. Hence the
subdominant hadronic radio emission may only be detectable in steep
spectrum radio sources \citep{2008Natur.455..944B}, which exhibit a
cutoff at lower radio frequencies and are thought to represent dying
RHs as a result of the decaying turbulence after a
merger. Alternatively, one could attempt to reconstruct the intrinsic
high-frequency RH spectrum by filling in the missing flux due to the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect by precise measurements of the Compton-$y$
parameter at microwave frequencies. Another possibility would consist
in stacking the radio data of radio-quiet clusters that due not
exhibit RH emission \citep{2011ApJ...740L..28B}. This may reveal the
glow of radio emission due to steady state secondary
population. Emission from faint secondary electrons should still be
visible, whereas due to the much more intermittent nature of DSA
injection, primary CRe will instead show a sharp cutoff due to
cooling, and will not be visible at high energies (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). We will pursue further implications and
distinguishing characteristics of these competing models in future
work.
