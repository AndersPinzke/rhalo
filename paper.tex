  About one third of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized
  radio emission on $\sim$Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos. One
  promising model for radio halos is Fermi II acceleration of seed
  relativistic electrons by turbulence in the intracluster medium
  (ICM); Coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from the thermal
  pool. However, the origin of seed electrons has never been fully
  explored. Here, we integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the
  cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton distributions in cosmological
  simulations of cluster formation. For standard assumptions,
  structure formation shocks lead to a seed electron population which
  produces too centrally concentrated radio emission. Instead, we
  present three plausible scenarios for the seed CRs that each
  can reproduce the spatially flat radio emission observed in the Coma
  cluster. (1) The CR proton to electron acceleration efficiency
  $K_\rmn{ep} \sim 0.1$ is assumed to be larger than in our Galaxy
  ($K_\rmn{ep} \sim 10^{-2}$), due to the magnetic geometry at the
  shock. The resulting primary electrons dominate the radio emission,
  which is more extended in comparison to radio emission from
  secondary electrons that result from hadronic CR interactions in the
  ICM. (2) CR protons may stream at the Alfv{\'e}n speed to the
  cluster outskirts when the ICM is relatively quiescent. A spatially
  flat CR proton distribution develops and produces the required
  population of secondary seed electrons. (3) The ratio of injected
  turbulent energy density to thermal energy density increase
  significantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. This
  generates a flat radio profile when CRs are reaccelerated even
  if the seed population of CRs is steep with radius. These competing
  non-trivial solutions provide incisive probes of non thermal
  processes in the high-$\beta$ ICM.

\section{Introduction}
About one third of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized
radio emission on $\sim$Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos (RHs)
\citep{2014IJMPD..2330007B}. They appear only in disturbed, merging
clusters and the RH luminosity correlates with the X-ray luminosity
\citep{2001A&A...369..441G,2012A&ARv..20...54F} and the Compton
$y$-parameter \citep{2013A&A...554A.140P}. The RHs show that CRs and
magnetic fields permeate a large volume fraction of the intra-cluster
medium (ICM). The dominant CR source, given the smoothness and
enormous extent of RHs, is thought to be structure formation shocks
\citep{miniati01,pfrommer08}. At the same time, plasma processes, the
origin of magnetic fields and particle acceleration in a turbulent,
high-$\beta$ plasma like the ICM are not well understood. Radio halos
thus provide an incisive probe of non-thermal processes in the ICM.

There have been two competing models proposed to explain RHs.  The
radio emitting electrons in the ``hadronic model'' are produced in
inelastic (hadronic) CR proton interactions with protons of the
ambient thermal ICM
(\citealp{1980ApJ...239L..93D,1999APh....12..169B,2001ApJ...562..233M,
  2004A&A...413...17P,2008MNRAS.385.1211P,ensslin11}). CR protons and
heavier nuclei may have been accelerated and injected into the ICM by
structure formation shocks, active galactic nuclei and galactic
winds. However, the strong bimodality that separates X-ray luminous
clusters into radio-active and radio-quite clusters (and requires a
fast switch on/off mechanism of the RH emission) and the very extended
RH emission at low frequencies in Coma (352~MHz) represent a major
challenge to this model class \citep{brunetti12,2014MNRAS.438..124Z}.

The alternative model for RHs is re-energization of seed
suprathermal electrons by Fermi II acceleration when ICM turbulence
becomes transonic during mergers
\citep{1987A&A...182...21S,1993ApJ...406..399G,2001MNRAS.320..365B,
  2004MNRAS.350.1174B,brunetti07,brunetti11}. Due to the short
radiative cooling time of high-energy relativistic electrons, the
cluster synchrotron emission quickly fades away after a merger, which
naturally explains the observed bimodality of RHs \cite[see
  e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.429.3564D,2014MNRAS.443.3564D}.

However, there is a salient piece missing in the turbulent
reacceleration model. It relies heavily on the assumption of an
abundant, volume-filling population of seed suprathermal electrons;
direct Fermi II acceleration from the thermal pool is precluded by
strong Coulomb losses
\citep{2008ApJ...682..175P,2012ApJ...759..113C}. These seeds are
presumed to be either fossil CR electrons (CRes) accelerated by
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) during structure formation
\citep{1999ApJ...520..529S}, or secondaries injected by hadronic
interaction of CR protons (CRps) with thermal protons
\citep{brunetti11}. While analytic estimates have been made, there has
been no ab initio demonstration that structure formation can lead to
the required abundance of seed electrons with the correct spatial and
spectral characteristics. This is a non-trivial requirement: Coulomb
cooling in dense cluster cores is severe, and DSA fossil electrons may
not survive. On the other hand, for secondaries to constitute the seed
population, the CRp population required in the best-studied case of
the Coma cluster must have a very broad and flat (or even slightly
inverted) spatial profile \citep{brunetti12}, in contrast with the
thermal plasma whose energy density declines steeply with radius. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:Edens} we show that such a distribution is not predicted by
cosmological simulations \cite[see
  also][]{pinzke10,2014MNRAS.439.2662V}.
\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{figures/fCR.radius.coma.g72a.Rad14.2400p.z0.NL.xKR.eb23.eI066.DII.140.v5.halo.test5.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{figures/turb_profile_ratio.eps}
  \caption{Left: spatial distribution of CRp energy density in the
    Coma cluster. The red dash-dotted line shows the required
    distribution of seed CRps that generate secondary electrons via
    p-p collisions required to reproduce Coma radio brightness
    observations after Fermi-II reacceleration \citep{brunetti12}. The
    blue solid line shows the distribution of fossil CRps found in
    cosmological simulations, which disagrees with the required
    profile. We normalize the required distribution of CRps by fixing
    the total CRp energy $E_\rmn{p}$ to 0.3 percent of the total
    thermal energy, consistent with observations
    \citep{2014ApJ...787...18A,2012ApJ...757..123A}. Right: the ratio
    of turbulent-to-thermal energy densities in our three models which
    is parametrised as $\epsilon_\rmn{turb} \propto
    \epsilon_\rmn{th}^{\alpha_{\rmn{tu}}}$. They are normalized such
      that the total turbulent energy for each scenario makes up 20\%
      of the total thermal energy inside the radio halo. Solid lines
      show the median ratio, while the dotted lines show the 68
      percentiles.}
    \label{fig:Edens}
\end{figure*}

Indeed, arriving at a seed population with the required
characteristics is highly constraining, and has the potential to teach
us much about the origin of CRps/CRes in clusters. In this paper we
consider three new scenarios that individually or combined can
reproduce the observed radio profiles and spectrum in the Coma cluster
without violating gamma-ray constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Model {\em M-primaries}.} If the acceleration efficiency of CRps is below
  about $0.1$~{\%} in weak (perpendicular) shocks and the ratio of injected
  electrons-to-protons $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim 0.1$, this yields a dominant primary
  population with a flat spatial distribution, since primaries have a weaker
  density dependence than secondaries.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-streaming}.} Here, we account for streaming CRps that
  produce flat distributions of CRps in the ICM
  \citep{ensslin11,wiener13,2014MNRAS.438..124Z}, which also flattens the
  secondary electron distribution.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-turbulence}.} Here, we adopt a significantly spatially
  flatter turbulent profile than what was adopted in \citet{brunetti12},
  but where seed CRps follow the steep profile that is suggested by
  structure formation simulations.
\end{enumerate}

To pursue these three possibilities further, we employ cosmological
simulations of CRs in clusters. In tandem with new insights from our
recent work on DSA generated fossil electrons \citep{pinzke13}, we
generate the first quantitative calculation of primary and secondary
seed electrons and compare to observations in the Coma cluster. For
the most part, we adopt parameters that are used in previous work: for
turbulence, see \citet[][ including turbulent spectrum, injection
  scale, energy density of turbulence]{brunetti07,brunetti11},
for CR acceleration in shocks, see \citet[][ in particular
  $K_{\rmn{ep}}$, acceleration efficiency]{pinzke13}, and for
cosmological simulations, see \citet[][ i.e., shock history,
  temperature profile, density profile, magnetic field
  profile]{pinzke10}. All these parameters are uncertain, and could
potentially change our predictions. We leave exploration of parameter
space and the interaction between free parameters to future work.

\section{Method} 

The transport of relativistic electrons and protons in
the ICM is a complex process that depends both on the details of the
thermal component (gas density, temperature, and pressure) as well as
non-thermal component (turbulence, magnetic fields, fossil CRs). We
use high resolution galaxy cluster simulations to derive the thermal
and fossil CR properties (shock accelerated primary CRes and CRps, as
well as secondary CRes produced in p-p collisions)
\citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,pfrommer08,pinzke10,pinzke13}. In this
paper we focus on our simulated cluster, g72a, which is a massive
$1.6\times10^{15}\,M_\odot$ cluster that experienced a merger about
1-2 Gyrs ago \citep{2009MNRAS.399..497D}. Since the cluster mass,
density and temperature profiles are all similar to the well studied
Coma cluster \citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,pinzke10}, we will compare our
calculations to radio and gamma-ray observations of Coma.

\subsection{Acceleration}

In our Galaxy, the CRe-to-CRp ratio at a few GeV is $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim
10^{-2}$. Hence, we adopt this as a fiducial value for the CRe-to-CRp
acceleration efficiency (see \citet{pinzke13} for more
discussion). However, as recent PIC simulations have shown, this is
likely very different at weak shocks, with electrons efficiently
accelerated at perpendicular shocks
\citep{2014ApJ...794..153G,2014ApJ...797...47G}, and ions efficiently
accelerated at parallel shocks \citep{2014ApJ...783...91C}. Thus,
depending on magnetic geometry, $K_{\rmn{ep}}$ could be either larger
or smaller. In this work we use a simple test-particle model for the
CRp acceleration, where we adopt a fit to Monte Carlo simulations of
the thermal leakage process that relates the momentum of injected
protons to the thermal energy of the shocked plasma \citep{kang11}. We
set an upper limit on the ratio of accelerated proton-to-dissipated
energy in the downstream of strong shocks that varies from 1-10\%,
depending on the adopted model (for more details, see Section
\ref{sec:results}). In order not to violate energy conservation with a
fixed limit for the acceleration efficiency, we steepen the spectral
index of the accelerated CRps at the limit \citep{pinzke13}, which
mimics the non-linear CR modification of the shock
\citep{ellison00}. For weak shocks the efficiency is a factor 10-100
lower and well below the limit. Some observations of radio relics
suggest high values of $K_{\rmn{ep}}$, due to the absence of gamma-ray
emission, which probes the CRp population
\citep{2014MNRAS.437.2291V}. This suggests primary CRes as a viable
alternative scenario to secondary CRes as seeds for the giant RHs. In
our {\em M-primaries} scenario, the injected distribution of CRes is
derived in the same way as for the CRps. Once they have been
accelerated to relativistic energies, injected electrons and protons
are indistinguishable. We therefore assume that CRp and CRe have the
same distribution function $f_\rmn{CRe}(p) = K_\rmn{ep}
f_\rmn{CRp}(p)$, with a different normalization (due to differing
acceleration efficiencies) $K_\rmn{ep}=0.1$ (viable for primarily
perpendicular shocks; \citet{2014ApJ...794..153G}). While this
appears to contradict the radial bias of magnetic fields in the bulk
of the ICM as suggested by observations \citep{2010NatPh...6..520P}
and cluster simulations \citep{2011ApJ...740...81R}, it does not
necessarily apply to the accretion shock regions, which show a field
geometry with a net perpendicular bias with respect to the shock
normal---at least for giant radio relics \citep{2010Sci...330..347V}.

\subsection{Cosmic ray transport}
As previously noted, secondaries produced by shock accelerated CRp
have the wrong spatial profile to explain RH observations; because
they arise from a two body process, they are too centrally
concentrated. They also produce $\gamma$-ray emission in excess of
Fermi-LAT upper limits
\citep{2012ApJ...757..123A,brunetti12,2014ApJ...787...18A}. However,
if CRps stream in the ICM, then their spatial profile could
potentially flatten sufficiently \citep{ensslin11,wiener13}. This
scenario is very attractive: it generates seed electrons with the
right spatial footprint, and by removing CRps from the core, obeys
gamma-ray constraints. Turbulence plays two opposing roles:
Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence damps waves generated by the CR streaming
instability \citep{yan02,farmer04}, thus reducing self-confinement;
but compressible fast modes scatter CRs directly. Turbulent damping is
still efficient for highly subsonic conditions \citep{wiener13}, while
we assume compressible fast modes only provide effective spatial
confinement during the periods of transonic, highly super-Alfv{\'e}nic
($M_{\rm A} \sim 5$) turbulence associated with mergers. Thus, CRs can
stream out when the cluster is kinematically quiescent. Furthermore,
even Alfv{\'e}nic streaming timescales are relatively short
\cite[$\sim 0.1-0.5$ Gyr;][]{wiener13} compared to the timescale on
which the CRp population is built up. Based on these findings, we
adopt a toy model for our \Mstream scenario in which CR streaming
quickly produces flat CRp profiles. We assume that CRs cannot stream
significantly past perpendicular $B$-fields at the accretion shock, so
that the total number of CRs is conserved within the galaxy cluster
during the streaming process.

Given a seed population of CRs, we adopt essentially the same set of
plasma physics assumptions as the reacceleration model for RHs
\citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}. We solve the isotropic, gyro-phase
averaged Fokker-Planck equation (via a Crank-Nicholson scheme) for the
time evolution of the CRe distribution in the Lagrangian frame
\citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}:
\begin{eqnarray}
{{d f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)}\over{d t}} &\!=&
\frac{\partial}{\partial p}
\left\{
f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)\left[
\left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm C} 
+ \frac{p}{3}\left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{\upsilon}\right)\right.\right.
\nonumber\\
&+& \left.\left. \left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm r}
- {1\over{p^2}}{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}\left(p^2 D_{pp}\right) 
\right]\right\} - \left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{\upsilon}\right) f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)
\nonumber\\
&+& {{\partial^2 }\over{\partial p^2}}
\left[
D_{pp} f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t) \right]+ Q_{\rmn{e}}\left[p,t;f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\right]   \, .
\label{elettroni}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $f_{\rmn{e}}$ is the one-dimensional distribution in position $x$
(suppressed for clarity), momentum $p$ and time $t$ (which is
normalized such that the number density is given by
$n_{\rmn{e}}(t)=\int d p f_{\rmn{e}}(p,t)$), $d/dt=\partial/\partial
t+\vec{\upsilon}\cdot \vec{\nabla}$ is the Lagrangian derivative,
$\vec{\upsilon}$ is the gas velocity, $|dp/dt|$ represents radiative
(r) and Coulomb (C) losses, $D_{pp}$ is the momentum space diffusion
coefficient, and $Q_{\rmn{e}}$ denotes the injection rate of primary
and secondary electrons in the ICM. The $\vec{\nabla}\cdot
\vec{\upsilon}$ terms represent adiabatic gains and losses. During
post-processing of our Coma-like cluster simulation, we solve the
Fokker-Planck equation over a redshift interval from $z=5$ to 0. The
simulated cluster undergoes a major merger over the last 1-2~Gyrs that
injects large turbulent eddies. After about 1~Gyr those have decayed
down to the scale needed to reaccelerate particles and the radio halo
turns on shortly after. This delay naturally explains why giant radio
halos are only seen in a fraction of all merging clusters. In all our
calculations we assume that turbulent reacceleration efficiently
accelerates particles for 650 Myrs (which is roughly the cascade time
on which turbulence is damped) and that during this turbulent phase CR
streaming and spatial diffusion can be neglected. In our \Mstream
model, CR streaming and diffusion are incorporated separately during
kinematically quiescent times that precede the merger. As a result,
flat CRp profiles are produced on relatively short timescales ($\sim
0.1-0.5$ Gyr).

The time evolution of the spectral energy distribution of CRps,
$f_{\rmn{p}}$, is similarly given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
{{d f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)}\over{d t}} &=&
{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}
\left\{
f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\left[ \left|{{dp}\over{dt}}\right|_{\rm C}
+ \frac{p}{3}\left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{\upsilon}\right)\right.\right.
\nonumber\\
&-&\left.\left. {1\over{p^2}}{{\partial }\over{\partial p}}\left(p^2 D_{pp}\right)
\right]\right\} - \left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{\upsilon}\right) f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)
\nonumber\\
&+& {{\partial^2 }\over{\partial p^2}}
\left[ D_{pp} f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t) \right] - {{f_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)}\over{\tau_{\rm had}(p)}}
+ Q_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)\, ,
\label{eq:FP_p}
\end{eqnarray}
where $Q_{\rmn{p}}(p,t)$ denotes the injection rate of shock
accelerated CRps as a function of momentum $p$ and time $t$, and
$\tau_{\rm had}$ is the timescale of hadronic losses that produce
pions via CRp collisions with thermal protons of the ICM
\cite[e.g.][]{brunetti11}.  

\subsection{Turbulent reacceleration}

We incorporate momentum diffusion for electrons and protons from
transit-time-damping (TTD) resonance with compressible
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, to model Fermi-II
reacceleration \citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}. The TTD resonance
requires the wave frequency $\omega=k_\parallel\upsilon_\parallel$,
where $k_\parallel$ and $\upsilon_\parallel$ are the parallel
(projected along the magnetic field) wavenumber and particle velocity,
respectively. This implies that the particle transit time across the
confining wave region matches the wave period,
$\lambda_{\parallel}/v_{\parallel}=T$. Note, the CRs' gyroradius does
not enter the resonance condition. Hence the CRs that are in resonance
with compressible waves experience Fermi-II acceleration
irrespectively of the length scale of the perturbation.

However, the resonance changes the component of particle momentum
parallel to seed magnetic fields, which over time leads to increasing
anisotropy in the particle distribution that decreases the efficiency
of reacceleration with time. As in \citet{brunetti11}, we assume that
there exists a mechanism---such as the firehose instability---that
isotropizes the CR distribution function at the gyroscale and on the
reacceleration time scale, which ensures sustained efficient
reacceleration with time. The particle pitch-angle averaged
momentum-diffusion coefficient of isotropic particles that couple to
fast magnetosonic modes via TTD resonance is \cite{brunetti07}
(Eqn. 47):
\begin{eqnarray}
  D_{pp}(p,t) = \frac{\pi}{16} \frac{p^2}{c\,\rho}
  \left\langle\frac{\beta |B_k|^2}{16 \pi \,W}\right\rangle
  I_\theta
  \int_{k_\rmn{cut}}\mathcal{W}(k)k\,d k\,,
\label{eq:dpp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta$ is the thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio, and $c$
is the speed of light. The energy density $W$ of a mode in a
magnetized plasma stems from both electromagnetic fields and resonant
particles. For a high-$\beta$ plasma, the pitch angle averaged ratio of
beta-weighted magnetic-to-total energy density saturates to $\langle\beta
|B_k|^2/2W\rangle\approx 10^{1.4}$ (see Figure 2 in
\citealt{brunetti07}). The pitch angle of the CR momentum with the
magnetic field orientation is given by $\theta$, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:I_theta}
  I_\theta=\int_0^{\arccos(\Vph/c)} d\theta {\frac{ \sin^3 \theta }{
    |\cos \theta | }}
\left[1+\left(\frac{\Vph}{c\,\cos{\theta}}\right)^2\right]^2.
\end{equation}
Here $V_\rmn{ph}$ is the phase velocity of the fast magnetosonic waves given
approximately by the sound speed, $\Vph \sim c_\rmn{s}$. For a sound speed
typical for the ICM of 1000~km/s, $I_\theta\approx5$. As in \cite{brunetti07},
we initially assume that the velocity of turbulent eddies is $V_0\approx 0.47
c_\rmn{s}$ throughout the cluster. This gives a turbulent acceleration time
scale, $\tau_{pp} = p^2/4D_{pp}$, that is typically few 100 Myrs in the ICM.

We adopt a simplified isotropic MHD turbulent spectrum for the fast
modes per elemental range $dk$ of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Wk}
  \mathcal{W}(k) =
\sqrt{2/7\,I_0\,\rho\,\langle \Vph \rangle}\,k^{-3/2},
\end{equation}
for $k_0<k<k_\rmn{cut}$, where we assume an injection scale for the
turbulence, $k_0= 2\pi/(100~\mbox{kpc})$. The volumetric injection
rate of turbulent energy, $I_0$, is fixed by requiring that the total
turbulent energy on the largest scales $E_\rmn{turb}=\int \int
\mathcal{W}(k) \rmn{d}k \rmn{d}V \approx 0.2 E_\rmn{th}$, where
$E_\rmn{th}$ is the total thermal energy \citep{brunetti07,brunetti11}
within the radio halo. In this work we investigate different spatial
models for injected turbulence. We assume that turbulent energy
density $\epsilon_\rmn{turb} \propto
\epsilon_\rmn{th}^{\alpha_\rmn{tu}}$, where $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.66$
for \Mflatturb, $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.81$ for \Mstream, and
$\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 0.88$ for \Mprimary (note that in previous work on
the Coma cluster, $\alpha_\rmn{tu}= 1$ was adopted \citep{brunetti12},
which together with the different distributions for seed CRes
constitute the main differences compared to our work). Our flatter
turbulent profiles are motivated by fits to cosmological simulations
\citep{2009ApJ...705.1129L,2010ApJ...725.1452S,2012ApJ...758...74B}
and the range indicates uncertainties of the turbulent profile in
Coma. Future observations (by Astro-H) and simulations will help to
clarify this issue. Provided dissipation of turbulence in the ICM is
collisionless, turbulent cascades of compressible modes become
suppressed when thermal and relativistic particles resonantly interact
with magnetosonic waves via TTD on a timescale $\Gamma^{-1}$ that
approaches the cascading timescale given by $\tau_{kk} \approx
k^2/D_{kk}$. Here the wave-wave diffusion coefficient of magnetosonic
modes is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dkk}
D_{kk} \approx \Vph k^4
\left(\frac{\mathcal{W}(k)}{\rho\,\Vph^2}\right).
\end{equation}
Thus, the cascade is suppressed for wave numbers above
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kc}
  k_\rmn{cut} \approx \frac{81}{14} \frac{I_0}{\rho \langle \Vph \rangle}
  \left(\frac{\langle\sum_i \Gamma_i(k,\theta)\rangle}{k}\right)^{-2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $2\pi/k_\rmn{cut}\sim 0.1-1$~kpc in the ICM. This constitutes an
effective mean free path for CRs, unless plasma instabilities can
mediate interactions between turbulence and particles on smaller
scales \citep{brunetti11}. In this work we only consider damping of
the turbulence via TTD due to thermal electrons, and neglect
subdominant damping with thermal protons and relativistic particles
(conversely, the turbulence has important effects on the
reacceleration of CRs). The latter will be subdominant in the ICM for
a CR-to-thermal energy density ratio $\lesssim 10 \%$
\citep{brunetti07}, which is always satisfied in our models. The
azimuthally averaged turbulent damping rate from thermal electrons
\citep{brunetti07} in a high-$\beta$ plasma is
\begin{equation}

\section{Results and Discussion} 
\label{sec:results}

After turbulent reacceleration, the volume-weighted, relative CRp
energy density and CRp number density inside the RH for \Mflatturb
(\Mstream), are found to be 3 (2) \% and $3.0\times10^{-8}$
($4.5\times10^{-8}$), respectively. As we will see later, these
densities are just of the right order of magnitude to reproduce radio
observations in the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray emission from CRps
that produce decaying neutral pions could be substantial if the CRps
are reaccelerated efficiently enough, hence it is interesting to
estimate this emission for our models and compare to upper limits. We
predict the gamma-ray emission from \Mflatturb (\Mstream) with
$F_\gamma(>500\,\rmn{MeV})=4.8\times10^{-10} (2.3\times10^{-10})
\mathrm{ \,ph\, s}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The fluxes from these
models are slightly larger than in \cite{brunetti12}, where the
differences comes from our steeper CRp profiles in addition to
simulation based formalism we rely on that accounts for both Coulomb
and hadronic losses during the build up of the CR distribution in
contrast to the scaling relations adopted in their
paper. Interestingly the gamma-ray flux from both our scenarios are
just below recent Fermi-LAT limits derived from a gamma-ray profile
similar to \Mflatturb where
$F_\gamma(>500\,\rmn{MeV})<5.3\times10^{-10} \mathrm{ \,ph\,
  s}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ \footnote{Fabio Zandanel, private
  communication. See also
  \citet{2014MNRAS.440..663Z,2014ApJ...787...18A}. and will be probed
  in the next few years by Fermi-LAT. } The spectral index of the CRp
distribution is relatively steep ($\alpha_{\rmn{p}}\sim2.6$) for the
CRp energies $E \gtrsim 10$~GeV that are relevant for the injection of
radio-emitting secondary CRes. The steep spectrum is ultimately a
consequence of our test particle model for Fermi-I acceleration
\citep{pinzke13}, where we steepen the spectral index to avoid
acceleration efficiencies above $\zeta_{\rmn{p}} \sim 10\%$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_profile}, we find that all three scenarios in
which the seeds undergo Fermi-II reacceleration can reproduce the Coma
RH profile at 352~MHz. In the panel {\it Brunetti et al. (2012)} we
show that without CR streaming or a flat turbulent profile, our
simulations of reaccelerated CRs produce radio profiles that are too
steep. Indeed, even using the assumptions of previous work -- where
complete freedom in the seed population was allowed -- it is not
possible to reproduce observations in both frequencies in any
model. Note that decreasing acceleration efficiency with radius does
not change this conclusion much because of the weak radial dependence
of $D_\rmn{pp}(R)\propto
\epsilon_\rmn{th}(R)^{(\alpha_\rmn{tu}+1)/2}/\sqrt{T(R)}$. This
signals that the problem is generic and requires either additional
modifications to the plasma physics of acceleration or a better
understanding of potential observational systematics. In addition
there are differences in the simulated density and temperature
profiles in comparison to the observed profile in Coma that impact the
CR abundance as well as cooling and reacceleration.

In principle, reacceleration via TTD leads to spectral steepening with
particle energy due to the inefficiency of the acceleration process to
counter the stronger cooling losses with increasing energy. Since
synchrotron emission peaks at frequency $\nu_\rmn{syn}\simeq 1\,
B/\mu\rmn{G} (\gamma/10^4)^2\,\rmn{GHz}$, this translates into a
spectral steepening of the radio spectrum (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). A given radio window samples higher
energy electrons for a decreasing field strength in the cluster
outskirts. Hence, the spectral steepening with energy should translate
into a radial spectral steepening \citep{brunetti12}. However, because
of the weak dependence of the electron Lorentz factor on emission
frequency ($\gamma\propto\sqrt{\nu_\rmn{syn}}$), this effect is only
visible in our simulations for $\nu_\rmn{syn}\gtrsim5$~GHz. Most
importantly, our simulated fluid elements at a given radius sample a
broad distribution of shock history, density and temperature, which
implies very similar synchrotron brightness profiles at
$\nu_\rmn{syn}=352$~MHz and 1.4 GHz. The discrepancy of the observed
and simulated 1.4 GHz profiles could instead be due to systematic flux
calibration error in single dish observations. These could arise, for
instance, due to errors in point source subtraction. Interestingly, we
can match the 1.4 GHz data if we reduce the zero point by adding 10\%
of the central flux to every data point; this flattens the outer
profile \footnote{Lawrence Rudnick, private communication.}.
Alternatively, this may point to weaknesses in the theoretical
modeling of the particle acceleration process and may require a
stronger cutoff in the particle energy spectrum.

\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum} we show that our three models that
include Fermi-II reacceleration can individually reproduce the
convexly curved total radio spectrum found in the Coma cluster. Seed
CRs in \Mstream and \Mflatturb that do not experience turbulent
reacceleration have a power-law spectrum in disagreement with
observations. In order to match both the spatial and spectral profiles
in Coma, we adopt an acceleration efficiency for the strongest shocks
in our three models \Mprimary, \Mstream, and \Mflatturb to
$\zeta_{\rmn{e}} <0.002$, $\zeta_{\rmn{p}} < 0.1$, and
$\zeta_{\rmn{p}}<0.025$, respectively. Following the Mach number
($\mathcal{M}$)-dependence of the acceleration efficiency suggested in
\cite{pinzke13}, the efficiency in weak shocks ($\mathcal{M}\sim
2.5-3.5$) that dominates the CR distribution function, has an
acceleration efficiency for protons $\zeta_{\rmn{p}}\sim0.0001-0.01$,
and for electrons $\zeta_{\rmn{e}}\sim 0.001$. Interestingly, we find
that the radio luminosity from clusters in the OFF-state (DSA only)
and ON-state (DSA and reacceleration) differ by about a factor 10 in
all our three models. However, note that for \Mprimary, the primary
CRes that generate most of the radio emission from the cluster in the
OFF-state are dominated by only a small fraction of the CRes. These
electrons are injected very recently and have not had time to cool
yet. Hence we expect there to be a large variance in the OFF-state of
different simulated clusters.

While the radio surface brightness has an approximate linear
dependence on the acceleration efficiency, it has a strong non-linear
dependence on the level of turbulence. Below a critical level ($X =
E_\rmn{turb}/E_\rmn{th} \sim 0.15$ in our fiducial model), turbulent
reacceleration is negligible, while it rises sharply above this
threshold. For instance, for $X>0.15$, a factor 2 change in $X$
changes the radio surface brightness by $\sim 10-100$. In principle
this threshold behavior allows us to provide a strict lower bound on
turbulence in radio halos. An even more stringent bound on $X$ can be
inferred from combining radio observations with the gamma-ray
observations where the predicted fluxes from both \Mstream and
\Mflatturb are close to the upper limits set by Fermi-LAT. If $X$ is
smaller than in our adopted models (where we assume $X=0.2$), then the
efficiency of DSA has to be larger than $\zeta_\rmn{p}\sim 0.1$ for
the secondary CRes to reproduce the radio observations. However, since
the turbulent reacceleration acts on both the secondary CRes and the
CRps, while $\zeta_\rmn{p}$ only affects the CRps, these models would
produce too much gamma-rays. Hence we conclude that $X\gtrsim0.2$ if
all other parameters are kept fixed. We will explore this parameter
space further in future work.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The standard reacceleration model for radio halos (RHs) requires
a population of seed electrons to undergo turbulent
reacceleration. These seeds are generally thought to be secondary
electrons from hadronic cosmic ray proton (CRp) interactions. In
this work we use cosmological simulations to derive a population of
seed CR protons originating from structure formation shocks and merger
shocks during the cluster build up. The resulting secondary population
is inconsistent with RH observations. We propose three possible
solutions that all produce gamma-ray emission below current upper
limits and that reproduce both, the spectrum and the surface
brightness profiles of the Coma radio halo: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Model {\em M-primaries}.} If indeed the acceleration
  efficiency of CRps is below about $0.1$ {\%} in weak shocks and the
  ratio of injected electrons and protons is $K_{\rmn{ep}} \sim
  10^{-1}$, CR electrons accelerated directly in shocks dominate over
  secondaries.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-streaming}.} Alternatively, CRps could stream
  out of the central core and produce flat CR profiles. This seed
  population of secondary CRes also has the correct spatial and
  spectral features alone, or potentially complements primaries to
  explain radio observations.
\item {\bf Model {\em M-turbulence}.}  Finally, injected turbulence
  that is flatter than in previously adopted models, which allows seed
  CRps to follow the steep radial profile that is suggested by
  structure formation simulations.
\end{enumerate}

Combining radio observations with gamma-ray constraints can be very
useful to learn about the plasma of the intracluster medium. Our
models (ii) and (iii) relies on CRps to induce secondary CRes that
produce the observed radio emission. In addition proton-proton
collisions produce neutral pions that decay into gamma rays. Since
turbulent reacceleration acts on both CRes and CRps, while the DSA
acceleration efficiency ($\zeta_p$) only acts on the CRps, radio
observations fix the relation between $X$ (the ratio of the total
turbulent energy to the thermal energy) and the acceleration
efficiency. With the addition of gamma-ray constraints from Fermi-LAT,
we can derive a lower limit to $X\gtrsim0.2$ and a upper limit to the
acceleration efficiencies of $\zeta_p\lesssim 10\%$ ($\zeta_p\lesssim
2.5\%$) for the two models, respectively, for our current choices of
other parameters.

How could we distinguish the different possibilities of a dominating
primary or secondary seed population of electrons observationally?
One possibility that is relative insensitive to adopted parameters in
our models is to use high-frequency radio observations (with e.g., the
Jansky Very Large Array) where turbulent reacceleration (which has a
high energy cutoff) is no longer efficient (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). The negative flux bowl of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect introduces a cutoff of the RH spectrum at
frequencies above $\gtrsim 10$~GHz \citep[][ depending on cluster mass
  and redshift]{2002A&A...396L..17E,Pfrommer:2003mk}. Hence the
subdominant hadronic radio emission may only be detectable in steep
spectrum radio sources \citep{2008Natur.455..944B}, which exhibit a
cutoff at lower radio frequencies and are thought to represent dying
RHs as a result of the decaying turbulence after a
merger. Alternatively, one could attempt to reconstruct the intrinsic
high-frequency RH spectrum by filling in the missing flux due to the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect by precise measurements of the Compton-$y$
parameter at microwave frequencies. Another possibility would consist
in stacking the radio data of radio-quiet clusters that due not
exhibit RH emission \citep{2011ApJ...740L..28B}. This may reveal the
glow of radio emission due to steady state secondary
population. Emission from faint secondary electrons should still be
visible, whereas due to the much more intermittent nature of DSA
injection, primary CRe will instead show a sharp cutoff due to
cooling, and will not be visible at high energies (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:sync_spectrum}). We will pursue further implications and
distinguishing characteristics of these competing models in future
work.
