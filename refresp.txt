In this work we adopt the turbulent model from Brunetti and Lazarian
2007. The diffusion constant (D_pp) in this model is used to calculate
the reacceleration and depends both on thermal quantities (gas density
and temperature) and on the compressible turbulence. We adopt a simple
model to calculate the compressible turbulence that relates the
turbulence to the thermal quantities of the cluster. We mainly use our
simulated Coma like cluster to derive the thermal properties of each
SPH particle, in addition to the CR distributions attached to each SPH
particle.

We have added a clarifying sentence to the first paragraph of Section
2.

"For simplicity, we do not calculate the turbulent parameters
explicitly. As discussed further in the following subsections, we
instead adopt simple models that allow us to relate these parameters
to the thermal quantities given by our simulated cluster."

We do not solve for CR streaming explicitly. Instead we rely on the
findings from Wiener et al. 2013, where CR protons stream on relatively
fast timescales which produce flat CR distributions almost
instantly. Hence we think that writing out the spatial dependence
explicitly for each term will not add to the paper, but instead worsen
the readability of equations considerably. However, we agree that the
terms for spatial diffusion should be included. Hence we have added
the necessary terms to the Fokker-Planck equation in Eqs. 1 and 2. In
addition, we have included discussions about the spatial dependence of
the diffusion constant D_pp into the first paragraph of Section 4.

We adopt the simple model for the turbulent spectrum from Brunetti and
Lazarian (2007). The spectrum is based on Kraichnan's picture and is
stationary with time. We think that simulations of the turbulent
spectrum in the ICM are still very uncertain and suffers from many
uncertainties like ... Hence, adopting a stationary spectrum is a
simplification, but not much worse than current
simulations. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING

Given Kraichnan's picture for the turbulent spectrum, the diffusion
constant is proportional to the square root of the smallest scales
k_c, which is about 0.1-1 kpc in the ICM. Hence for this spectrum the
smallest scales are most efficient in reaccelerating particles. For
more details see the text below equation 8. Note that a flatter
spectral index makes D_pp more dependent on the injection scale of
turbulence than the cut_off scale, where the crossover takes place at
a spectral index of -1.

We have clarified the text in our revised paper. It now reads: "The
simulated cluster undergoes a major merger over the last 1-2 Gyrs that
is thought to inject large turbulent eddies. Following Brunetti &
Lazarian (2007, 2011) (see also Yan & Lazarian 2004; Beresnyak et
al. 2013) we assume that about one Gyr after core passage the fields
have decayed down to the smallest scales where reacceleration is most
efficient (Dpp ∼ k_cut) and the radio halo turns on shortly
after. Note that the exact decay time of the turbulens is of minor
importance, since the thermal and CR quantities are very similar a few
100 Myrs before and after z = 0 where we have chosen to evaluate the
simulations. This delay naturally explains why giant radio halos are
only seen in a fraction of all merging clusters. In all our
calculations we assume that turbulent reacceleration efficiently
accelerates particles for τ_cl ∼ 650 Myrs (which is roughly the cascade
time on which turbulence is damped) and that during this turbulent
phase CR streaming and spatial diffusion can be neglected."

We believe that current simulations of turbulence are not conclusive
regarding this point and follow the assumptions from Brunetti and
Lazarian which are also supported the simulations of e.g. Beresnyak et
al. 2013.

We use the same assumption for the injection scale of turbulence as in
Brunetti and Lazarian 2007, 2011. The injection scale that is derived
from simulations is very uncertain due to ...

In the revised version of the paper the normalization is with respect
to the turbulence in compressible modes. We have added clarifying
statements to the text.

We assume that the turbulent profile of compressible modes is
proportional to the thermal energy density to some power
\alpha_tu. This produce turbulent profiles not too different from
simulations (see e.g. Lau et al. 2009; Shaw et al. 2010; Vazza et
al. 2011; Battaglia et al. 2012). Because of the large spread in
turbulent profiles in addition to the unknown profile of the
compressible modes in the literature, we exploit this large
uncertainty and adjust alpha_tu for each model so that the CRs have
the correct spatial profile to match the radio emission. Since the
diffusion constant, $D_pp \propto eps_th^(\alpha_tu-1)$, small
differences in $\alpha_tu$ will impact the final radio profile
significantely, hence for consistency we write out two digits for this
parameter. 

We have also added a new subsection where we discuss the robustness of
the results to both turbulent parameters as well as CR
parameters. There we show that radio emission is much more sensitive
to assumptions about turbulent parameters than CRs.

We agree that this is a strong assumption, but again, we clearly state
in our paper that we follow the same line of arguments for the TTD put
forward by Brunetti and Lazarian 2007 (see Section 5.1 in their paper).

We have added a paragraph to the beginning of section 4 where we
discuss the uncertainty of the most important parameters and how they
impact the result. In addition we have a brief disccussion about why
each model can reproduce the radio data. We have also divided up
section 4 into three subsection for better readability: radio profile,
radio spectrum, and gamma-rays.

We have revised the text in the several parts of the paper so that it
should be clear that the main goal of the paper is to find different
scenarios for the CR physics and the turbulence that lead to a
distribution of CRs that reproduce the observed Coma radio halo
without violating gamma-ray bounds.

**************************************************
I have read the submitted manuscript titled “Turbulence and Particle Acceleration in Giant Radio Halos: the Origin of Seed Electrons” by Pinzke et al. The paper addresses the origin of the seed energetic particles in the re-acceleation models of giant radio halos. This is of general interest as the reaceleration models have come under increased interest and scrutiny recently. The paper also contains potentially interesting results. 
However, important concerns have to be addressed and revisions need to be made before the manuscript can be recommended for publication.
In particular, while the authors show that their three models can reproduce the radio spectrum and profile observed in Coma cluster, the results is poorly discussed and it appears the result of a parameter fitting effort. In addition, the turbulent model seems at odds with recent development in the field. Finally, besides the parameters introduced by the authors, their results rely on other important assumptions about the ICM properties which could completely change the picture and, therefore, should be discussed in the discussion section.


Below please find more specific comments on the above together with other minor comments.
1)
It is very unclear how the authors use the simulation data and section 2.2 in this respect is quite confusing.
The main ingredients entering the integration of Eq. 1 are the transport coefficients. In Brunetti and Lazarian’s model these coefficient are determined primarily by the compressional turbulence energy spectrum. In fact, the turbulence model appears to be assumed based previous work of Brunetti and Lazarian. So what do they use the simulation for ? This should be made clear.
The spatial dependence is removed for clarity, but the spatial distribution of the radio emission is one of the aims of the authors, and at least one of the models is named after the streaming process, so this choice is confusing. In fact all the spatial transport terms, including spatial diffusion, should be included explicitly and somewhere in the paper the assumed value for the relative coefficients should be given, together with the other transport coefficient (see more below).
Section 2.2 states: “The simulated cluster undergoes a major merger over the last 1-2 Gyr that injects large turbulent eddies. After about 1 Gyr those have decayed down to the scales needed to reaccelerate particles and the radio halo turns on shortly after. This delays naturally explains why radio halos are only seen in a fraction of merging clusters.” 
Where is the evidence for this ? Can the authors show time dependent turbulent spectra indicating that ? Or is there a reference in support? Also, what are “the scales needed to reaccelerate particles” ? And how does this information affect the results anyway?
Without any evidence it all sounds very speculative. In addition it apparently contradicts the results of numerical simulations in Miniati (2015) showing that the compressional turbulent energy actually peaks at core passage and that 1 Gyr after that has basically decayed to a level that is insufficient for accelerating GHz emitting relativistic particles. So if this is important for their results, the authors should provide supporting evidence for it, else remove it.

2) 
The specifics of the turbulent model are not very clear. 
First the injection scale is only 100 kpc, there is no reference to support this value, which is at odds with simulation results (Vazza et al 2009, 2011, Miniati 2014, 2015), indicating several times large injection scales. 
In addition it is not clear if the normalisation with respect to the thermal energy refers to the total turbulent energy or the compressional component which is what produces particle acceleration. In the former case they should mentioned the assumed fraction of compressional turbulence.
in general the authors should comment on how their assumed turbulent model, in terms of energy and temporal evolution, compares with recent high resolution simulation results (Vazza et al 2009, 2011, Miniati 2014, 2015).
What is the motivation for the very carefully chosen values of \alpha_tu indices, which furthermore take different values for each different mode?
The role of TTD damping by relativistic particles depends on the mean free path of the thermal particles. So it isn’t subdominant in general, as stated in the paper, but only if one assumes that the mean free path of the thermal particles is determined by Coulomb collisions, which is a strong assumption.
3)
The discussion section should be better organised.
First the authors should discuss and explain how each different model is capable of reproducing the observational data. 
It is important to provide an intuitive picture and describe 
what are the crucial processes at work in each scenario that contribute to the final relativistic electrons and radio profile. 
what are the adopted values of the physical parameters describing such processes and 
what range of values is acceptable given the observational constraints.
Without such discussion the value of the authors’ results remains obscure. As mentioned earlier, it could be the result of parameter fitting with little physical relevance. In addition, it would not be possible to use observations of radio halos to infer the conditions in the ICM as suggested at the end of Sec. 3.
Fig 2 presenting the main results is hardly discussed or described at all.
In fact, the discussion contains some interesting points but their presentation is not very clear.
Perhaps it should be made very clear from the beginning what is the main issue that the authors are trying to address. It appears to be the simultaneous explanation of both the spectral and spatial profiles of diffuse radio emission in Coma. This should be clearly stated in the beginning and then the discussion should unfold from there, with the presentation of the authors’ successful models, the discussion of the physics, strength and weaknesses of those models as mentioned above, with emphasis on the physics required by the observations, then the observational subtleties/potential pitfalls, and so on. 
The acceleration rates by compressible turbulence depend dramatically on subtle features, including the presence of microscopic instabilities, discussed in Brunetti & Lazarian (2011), Beresnyak et al. (2013) and Miniati (2015), and the shape of the cascade of fast magnetosonic waves discussed in Miniati (2015). Since these effect can change completely the results of this paper, they should be discussed in the discussion section and also mentioned in the introduction to provide a more complete picture about the state of the field.
4)
The acceleration efficiency of electrons and protons at weak shocks in the intracluster medium is highly uncertain and it is certainly possible that these efficiencies differ substantially from the values observed in the interstellar medium. So assuming a larger K_ep parameter is a valid working hypothesis.
However, the justification based on a biased orientation of the magnetic field  appears artificial because there is no reason to expect the magnetic field in front of weak ICM shocks to be mostly perpendicular. Certainly one cannot reach such conclusion based on the cited observation of polarisation vectors (van Werren 2010), as such polarization pattern is naturally produced under the geometrical conditions of an edge on relic/shock.
But, again, assuming K_ep different/larger than 0.01 is nevertheless a reasonable assumption.

Line 16-17 of first paragraph at page 4 is not very clear. What is the length scale of the perturbation? Is it the wavelength  of the compressible wave ?
