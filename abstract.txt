 About one third of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized
  radio emission on ~Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos. One
  promising model for radio halos is Fermi II acceleration of seed
  relativistic electrons by turbulence in the intracluster medium
  (ICM); Coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from the thermal
  pool. However, the origin of seed electrons has never been fully
  explored. Here, we integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the
  cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton distributions in cosmological
  simulations of cluster formation. For standard assumptions,
  structure formation shocks lead to a seed electron population which
  produces too centrally concentrated radio emission. Instead, we
  present three plausible scenarios for the seed CRs that each
  can reproduce the spatially flat radio emission observed in the Coma
  cluster. (1) The CR proton to electron acceleration efficiency
  K_ep ~ 0.1 is assumed to be larger than in our Galaxy
  (K_ep ~ 0.01), due to the magnetic geometry at the
  shock. The resulting primary electrons dominate the radio emission,
  which is more extended in comparison to radio emission from
  secondary electrons that result from hadronic CR interactions in the
  ICM. (2) CR protons may stream at the Alfv√©n speed to the
  cluster outskirts when the ICM is relatively quiescent. A spatially
  flat CR proton distribution develops and produces the required
  population of secondary seed electrons. (3) The ratio of injected
  turbulent energy density to thermal energy density increase
  significantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. This
  generates a flat radio profile when CRs are reaccelerated even
  if the seed population of CRs is steep with radius. These competing
  non-trivial solutions provide incisive probes of non thermal
  processes in the high-beta ICM.
